# Dev Tools Project - Current Status (2025-07-20)

## 🎯 What's Working

### ✅ **Database Access Confirmed**
- **PostgreSQL**: `cosmetics_data_hub_v2_local`
- **78 formulas** and **563 ingredients** accessible
- Connection tested and working via `src/database/test-db-connection.js`

### ✅ **Monday.com API Integration Ready**
- **4 working scripts** copied from cosmetics-monday-integration:
  - `src/monday/discover-workspaces.js` - Lists all workspaces
  - `src/monday/find-crm-boards.js` - Maps CRM boards
  - `src/monday/deep-trace-accounts.js` - Traces Accounts board connections
  - `src/monday/generate-accounts-mermaid.js` - Creates Mermaid diagrams

### ✅ **Existing Analysis Available**
- **CRM Workspace**: ID 11007618 with 25 boards mapped
- **Accounts Board**: ID 9161287533 with 7 mirror connections traced
- **Output files** in `output/` directory:
  - `crm-boards-config.json` - All CRM boards
  - `accounts-deep-connections.json` - Connection mapping
  - `accounts-board-diagram.md` - Working Mermaid visualization

### ✅ **Dependencies Installed**
- All npm packages installed successfully
- Environment file `.env` created (needs MONDAY_API_TOKEN)

## 🚀 Ready for Next Chat

### Quick Start Commands:
```bash
# Test database access
node src/database/test-db-connection.js

# Discover workspaces  
npm run discover-workspaces

# Map CRM boards
npm run find-crm-boards

# Trace Accounts connections
npm run trace-accounts

# Generate Mermaid diagram
npm run generate-mermaid
```

### Environment Setup:
1. Add your Monday API token to `.env`:
   ```
   MONDAY_API_TOKEN=your_token_here
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps for New Chat

1. **Initialize Git** and push to GitHub
2. **Verify current CRM state** - run find-crm-boards.js
3. **Update Accounts connections** - run deep-trace-accounts.js  
4. **Generate fresh Mermaid diagram** showing current board relationships
5. **Extend analysis** to other key boards (Contacts, Projects, Dev Deals, Prod Deals)

## 📊 Key Discoveries from Analysis

### Successful Monday.com Patterns:
- **Authentication**: `mondaySDK()` with `setToken(process.env.MONDAY_API_TOKEN)`
- **Rate limiting**: 500ms delays between API calls
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive try/catch with response.data checks
- **Connection discovery**: Filter columns by type `mirror`, `board-relation`, `dependency`

### Known Board Structure:
- **CRM Workspace**: 25 boards including Accounts, Contacts, Projects, Dev/Prod Deals
- **Accounts Board**: Central hub with 7 mirror connections to other workspaces
- **Missing boards**: Shopify Integration, Development Board (referenced but not accessible)

### Working Mermaid Generation:
- Workspace-grouped subgraphs with color coding
- Styled connections showing mirror relationships
- Legend for clarity
- Handles missing/inaccessible boards gracefully

The project is fully set up and ready for immediate use!
